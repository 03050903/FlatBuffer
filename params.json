This should result in a flatc executable\r\n* Now create your schema file with extension .fbs. Guide to write a schema can be found [here](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_guide_writing_schema.html).And also have your sample json file.\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./flatc -j -b schema.fbs sample.json\r\n```\r\n* This will create few java file and one bin file. Java files are like model(POJO for flatBuffer) of your json.Place the java files in your application package and bin file in raw folder(bin file is only for testing as it is converted to byte that is to be passed to flatbuffer for testing).\r\n* Now we have to get flatbuffer jar file.\r\n```sh\r\n$ cd flatbuffers\r\n$ cd java\r\n$ mvn install\r\nThis will download all the dependencies.\r\n$ cd target\r\n```\r\n* Here we will get the flatbuffers-java-1.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar file that you have to put it in your libs folder of android project.\r\n* For rest you can see my sample project.\r\n\r\n## Major steps:\r\n* Prepare your schema.fbs.\r\n* Have a sample json.\r\n* Build flatBuffer google project to generate your java files to be used in main application.\r\n* Generate java files.",
